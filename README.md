# SmallJSProjects

Welcome to the project repository! This repository contains a collection of small, vanilla HTML, JS, and CSS projects. Each project is designed to showcase different concepts and techniques in web development.

## Project Structure

The repository follows a simple and consistent structure for each project. Inside each project directory, you'll find the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that defines the structure of the project.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that handles the visual styling of the project.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic and interactivity of the project.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different features and functionalities.

## Running Projects

To run a project, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The browser will render the HTML, apply the CSS styles, and execute the JavaScript code. You can interact with the project directly in the browser window.

In some cases, you may need a local development server to run certain projects. If that's the case, please refer to the specific project's README file for instructions on how to run it.
